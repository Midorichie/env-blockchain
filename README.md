# Environmental Conservation Blockchain Project

## Overview
This project leverages blockchain technology to enhance transparency and accountability in environmental conservation efforts. By using Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, we create an immutable, trustless system for tracking conservation project funding and impact.

## Key Features
- Transparent project creation
- Verifiable fund contributions
- Immutable impact metric tracking
- Decentralized project management

## Technologies
- Blockchain: Stacks
- Smart Contract Language: Clarity
- Backend: Python
- Interaction Library: Stacks Python Client (Hypothetical)

## Smart Contract Capabilities
1. Create conservation projects
2. Contribute funds to projects
3. Track project status
4. Record and verify impact metrics

## Setup Instructions
1. Install Stacks CLI
2. Deploy smart contract to Stacks testnet
3. Configure Python backend
4. Set up environment variables

## Contribution Workflow
1. Project Proposal
2. Community Validation
3. Funding Phase
4. Project Execution
5. Impact Reporting

## Future Improvements
- Multi-signature project approval
- Dynamic funding mechanisms
- Advanced impact metric validation
